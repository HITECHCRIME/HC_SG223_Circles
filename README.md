## Lyrics

```
get to the crib all wrong
get to the crib all wrong yeah

get to the crib all wrong
get to the crib all wrong yeah

(what's)
better the reason to draw all your circles
for wishes that won't be fulfilled

salt it out
sort it out, damn you father of rituals 

get to the crib all wrong
get to the crib all wrong yeah

(get to the crib all wrong
get to the crib all wrong yeah)

all the circles aren't paying off
ya ya
saying what you want through your prayers
won't bring anything back

```
